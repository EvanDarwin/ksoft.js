# ksoft.js

**This version supports Node.js v14+ only**, as it incorporates some of the very shiny new language features. If your environment does not have Node.js v14, I heavily encourage upgrading, as it brings other benefits as well.

## Install

`npm i @ksoft/api`


## Documentation

You can find the docs [here](https://js.docs.ksoft.si).
